Allows a topic page in LearnDash to be completed through an action conducted in Storyline or Captivate embedded content.

== Description ==

If your eLearning authoring tool of choice is either Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate, you will already know that you can embed your digital content within a LearnDash LMS topic page. 

But what if you don’t want your learners to be able to ‘Mark Complete’ before they have completed a task? i.e. what if your learners have to finish your full Storyline presentation? What if your learners must achieve a certain mark in your Storyline quiz? Or what if your learners need to interact with a game or watch a video before being able to move onto submit an assignment or take a LearnDash quiz?

Our LearnDash Topic Progression Using Storyline/Captivate plugin allows you to do just that! 

You will now have full control over how your learner must interact with your digital content in order to progress through your course, by using a very simple JavaScript command within your Storyline or Captivate content, you will be able to dictate when exactly the Mark Complete process should be triggered.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any other eLearning Authoring Tools?  =

Yes! As long as you can activate JavaScript code you can use this plugin with other authoring tools, or advanced multimedia development software such as Adobe Animate CC.

= What about Articulate Rise? =

 The latest version of our plugin does support content produced in Articulate Rise! Your content must include a Storyline block which contains a button that triggers the required JavaScript. For more details, please refer to the plugin User Guide available on our website.

= Is this plugin something to do with SCORM? =

No, this plugin does not capture any information from the eLearning content. This only allows you to use content on the current page to activate the Mark Complete function within LearnDash.

= Will the plugin still work if I use a different word for Topics and Mark Complete using LearnDash’s Custom Fields options? =

Yes, using the LearnDash custom fields options does not interfere at all with the functionality of this plugin.

= What happens if the topic has already been marked as complete and the learner returns to the page to review the content =

We have introduced a new feature into Version 1.1 which will automatically move the user onto the next page in the course if the mark complete process has already been triggered. Make sure your plugin version is up-to-date to take advantage of this.

= Can I use this plugin to mark lessons as complete using Storyline/Captivate content as well? =

Our free plugin version is designed to only work with LearnDash Topic pages. If you also want the ability to auto mark Lesson pages, as well as being able to hide and reveal the Mark Complete button using Storyline or Captivate, [visit our webstore](http://www.discoverelearninguk.com/store/) to download our premium version.

= I need some support getting Storyline looking and working great within LearnDash. Can we contact you for help? =
